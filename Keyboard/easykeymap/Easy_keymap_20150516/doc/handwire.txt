HOWTO: Easy AVR USB Keyboard Firmware - Using the hand-wired matrix
metalliqaz@geekhack

==============
Introduction
============

Although Easy AVR USB firmware builds are programmable, the hardware details
must be pre-compiled and incorporated into the tool.  Therefore, in order for
a new hand-wired keyboard design to work with Easy AVR USB firmware, it must
be wired according to this pre-defined description.

For lack of a better standard layout, I have chosen the venerable Phantom
hardware configuration as the default model for this layout.

=======================
Hardware Requirements
=====================

A Teensy 2.0, programmable with the Teensy Loader
Up to 102 (6x17) switches
Diodes for each switch
Up to 2 LEDs, with matching resistors

========================
Electrical Connections
======================

Remember that diodes and LEDs are directional and must be installed with the
correct orientation for the system to work.

Diodes must be installed such that current flows from Row to Col.

LEDs must be installed such that current flows from the pin to ground.

=================
Pin Assignments
===============

Note:
Top left (typically Esc) is Row 0, Col 0
Bottom right (typically arrow) is Row 5, Col 16

The following assignments may be reconfigured by modifying the MATRIX section
of the handwire_hardware.cfg file in the cfg directory.

Row 0: B5
Row 1: B4
Row 2: B3
Row 3: B2
Row 4: B1
Row 5: B0

Col  0: D5
Col  1: C7
Col  2: C6
Col  3: D4
Col  4: D0
Col  5: E6
Col  6: F0
Col  7: F1
Col  8: F4
Col  9: F5
Col 10: F6
Col 11: F7
Col 12: D7
Col 13: D6
Col 14: D1
Col 15: D2
Col 16: D3

LED0: B6
LED1: B7

=================
Making a Layout
===============

Once the board is wired, each switch will have a (row,col) coordinate.  To 
assign a key, find that coordinate in the keymapper application and assign
your selected function.  The layout may be located anywhere within the 6x17
matrix, as long as it fits.

The layout view in the keymapper is configurable with .cfg files.  This step
is purely cosmetic and is not required.  If you wish to customize the view,
an example .cfg file is provided.
